# My Personal Project

## Workout Tracker

The workout tracker application will have four main functions:
- The first (and obvious) function will be to store the user's previous workouts, with the ability to customize each workout session
  - For example, the user would be able to customize how heavy they lifted, so they can track their progress
- The second function would be to give the user the ability to input their workouts
- The third function would be to suggest what type of workouts would be best for certain muscles groups/types of exercises
  - For example, if the user wants to exercise their chest muscles, the application will recommend chest exercises (with and without equipment)
  - Another example, if the user wants to do cardio, it will provide cardiovascular exercises (with and without equipment)
- The final feature would be to provide some everyday fun facts that promote a healthier lifestyle for the user

The project is for personal use, but could easily be used by others who either are just starting out their workout journey
or are already very experienced (essentially for everyone that wants to work out). This application would be incredibly useful
as it streamlines the process of working out and hence, reduces the friction of workout so that you don't give up on your
New Year Resolutions as quick!

This project is interesting to me personally because I have been on my workout journey for almost 2 years now. So, this application
is directly correlated to one of my hobbies/interests. As well as, I have had a great experience with working out, specifically,
I felt a massive confidence boost as well as just felt healthier as I progressed through my journey. So, I believe that creating this project can help some
beginners (or even people that want to start working out) to get into the habit of working out more easily, so they can also experience
what I have experienced.
